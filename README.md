# 🌌 Wander

**Frictionless environments for the "Minus One" phase of ideation.**

## 🧭 The Philosophy

AI should push creatives and worldbuilders to collaborate between each other, while AI agents work as a third wheel that adds stability and reduces friction, pushing creatives towards a state of flow and wandering.

The amount of people require to create great products just keeps getting smaller. The world demands more founders, more ideas… weirder ideas. For this to happen, we need an environment in which people are giving the space to look outside what's possible, what's expected.

These world models have a great understanding on our environment, but not so much on ourselves, our intent, our emotions, our patterns, our behaviors. **Wander bridges this gap.**

## 🖐️ The Three Senses (Current Multi-Modal Bridge)

To achieve this state of "stable flow," Wander removes the friction of traditional interfaces and replaces them with a more organic connection to the **Odyssey-2 Pro** model:

**Voice (The Narrative):** Real-time speech recognition allows the user to jam with the AI. The fable evolves as you speak it, mid-stream.

**Vision (The Emotional Palette):** Passive sensing of facial expressions informs the model of the user's emotional state. Your subconscious feelings alter the visual "Cognitive Context" (e.g., joyful expressions trigger vibrant, energetic evolutions).

**Gestures (Spatial Intent):** Point at objects or areas within the generated world. Wander translates spatial coordinates into intent, allowing you to say *"Make this blue"* while pointing at a specific element without having to name it.

## 🚀 How to Use

**Initialize:** Enter your Odyssey API Key in the startup panel.

**Awaken Senses:** Click **"Start Wandering"** and allow Microphone and Camera access.

**Enter the Flow:** Once the senses are active, let your mind drift. Speak, gesture, and emote. The AI acts as your collaborative partner, reflecting your internal stream of thought into a real-time cinematic world.

## 🔮 The Future: Deepening the Connection

Wander is only the beginning of a truly bio-integrated creative environment. Our roadmap includes expanding the "Senses" into the user's internal physiological state:

**Biometric Synchronization (Apple Watch/Wearables):** Integrating real-time Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data to detect when a user is stressed vs. when they have reached a true **Flow State**. The AI can then adjust the world’s complexity or "calm" to sustain that state.

**Spatial Provenance (Location Intelligence):** Automatically tagging "Conceptual Spaces" with physical GPS data. This allows users to revisit ideas based on *where* they were inspired—understanding that a fable written in a bustling city park carries a different "foundational energy" than one born in a quiet forest.

**Subconscious Recording:** Saving the metadata of the "Wander" session—not just the video, but the emotional and physiological trajectory—to help founders analyze their own patterns of breakthrough thinking.
